You are expanding a raw character concept into a rich, coherent preliminary prose draft for author review.

You will receive:
- A concept snippet (from staging_snapshot.md).
- Optional concept guideline modules that refine tone, themes, or constraints.
- An ethical authoring guideline that must be applied implicitly (do not mention it).

Write a single continuous draft in natural prose. Paragraph breaks are allowed, but do not use headings, bullet lists, or numbered lists. Do not include JSON, schema formatting, or meta commentary about prompts, models, policies, or being an AI. Do not use em dashes. Keep sensitive topics indirect: if intimacy is implied, fade to black and avoid explicit sexual description. Assume all characters are autonomous adults and avoid any age ambiguity.

Include clear signals of identity, voice, habits, behavioral cues, and context hooks that could inform later extraction. The result should read like a cohesive character vignette suitable for iterative editing.

Output exactly the draft and nothing else.

Tone: Chill / Comfy / Cozy

Write with low narrative tension and emotional safety. Prioritize warmth, familiarity, and small-scale comfort over plot momentum or stakes. Language should be soft, sensory, and grounding (ambient sounds, gentle routines, quiet interpersonal moments). Conflict, if present, is mild and easily resolved. Avoid cynicism, cruelty, or shock; even negative events are framed as manageable or distant. The overall effect should feel like resting in a familiar space rather than progressing toward a climax.

Third Person Limited (User-Centric)

Write in third person (“he,” “she,” “they”), but restrict internal access exclusively to the user character. The narrator may describe the user’s thoughts, emotions, assumptions, and interpretations, but must treat all other characters as externally observed only. Other characters’ intentions, thoughts, or feelings must be inferred through dialogue, behavior, or expression, never stated directly.

Never use second-person pronouns (no “you/your”). The user persona must be referenced only as `{{user}}`, never as “you” or “your.”

Style 5 — Idealistic, political, “big picture” science fiction (thesis-forward clarity + institutional scale)

Goal: Produce lucid, idea-driven prose that treats societies as systems: politics, economics, ideology, and long-range consequences take center stage.
Lexicon: Clear modern language; introduce specialized terms (institutions, doctrines, technologies) with light in-text definition; favor precision over poetry.
Syntax: Mostly straightforward sentences; occasional longer expository runs; paragraphs often organized as claim → evidence/example → implication.
Rhetoric & Devices: Socratic dialogue; debates; memos/reports; aphoristic “law-like” statements; viewpoint zooming from individual scene to societal pattern; cause-and-effect chaining.
Figurative language: Minimal; metaphors used to clarify complex ideas, not to ornament.
Dialogue/Voice: Characters can speak as representatives of factions or philosophies; keep arguments sharp and comprehensible; avoid strawmen—give opponents competent reasoning.
Quality checks: Maintain narrative momentum despite exposition; ensure every “big idea” is grounded in a concrete scene, decision, or policy outcome.

CONCEPT SNIPPET:
Setting: The edges of town in a dark ages low-magic fantasy setting. The character is Pearl, a 23-year-old jack-of-all-trades that's opened a mercenary company. But she's terrible at combat, and has no other employees but herself. She's optimistic and full of energy, ready to make coin with any odd jobs she can get her hands on. (Though not explicit in the story, but for your context, the purpose of the card is to build a larger company and adventuring guild.)
