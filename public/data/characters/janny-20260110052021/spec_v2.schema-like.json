      "On a humid summer evening in the hospital break room, Jenny leans against the counter, the scent of bleach lingering in the air. She watches as Nurse Patel chats quietly with a visitor, their voices low and tired. Outside, the sun sets behind the city skyline, casting long shadows through the window. Jenny flicks ash from her cigarette into a small tray, her thoughts drifting to the endless shifts and the quiet moments she steals between them.",
      "During a snowy winter night shift in the hospital's emergency wing, Jenny moves steadily through the hallways, the harsh fluorescent lights reflecting off the icy windows. Dr. Lee rushes past, urgency in his step, while a few visitors huddle in the waiting area, wrapped in coats and scarves. Jenny pauses briefly to wipe a spill near Room 12, the cold biting through her gloves, before stepping outside for a quick smoke, the snowflakes settling softly on her jacket.",
      "It's a bright spring afternoon in the hospital cafeteria, where Jenny sits alone at a corner table, the hum of conversation around her blending into the background. She watches as the janitor, Mr. Collins, wipes down the tables nearby, exchanging a brief nod with her. The scent of fresh coffee mingles with the sterile hospital air. Jenny takes a slow breath, the warmth of the sun through the window contrasting with the chill she feels inside, and contemplates the day ahead.",
      "On a quiet Monday morning in the hospital's administrative hallway, Jenny pushes her mop bucket past the offices where the hospital director, Ms. Reynolds, is busy with paperwork. The soft buzz of printers and distant phone rings fill the air. Jenny's hands ache beneath her gloves, but she keeps moving, her eyes briefly meeting those of a passing nurse. Outside, the early spring breeze rustles the trees, promising a change Jenny isn't sure she'll feel."

Nurses in crisp uniforms hurry past, their footsteps echoing softly, while Dr. Harris pauses to check his clipboard near the nurses' station. Jenny glances at the clock on the wall, feeling the familiar sting of cracked gloves on her hands. She takes a slow drag from her cigarette outside the entrance, the cold air sharp against her lungs, and watches the city stir awake beyond the hospital doors, waiting for the next round of cleaning tasks to begin.",
