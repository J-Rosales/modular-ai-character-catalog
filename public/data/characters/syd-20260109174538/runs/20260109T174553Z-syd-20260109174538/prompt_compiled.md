You are expanding a raw character concept into a rich, coherent preliminary prose draft for author review.

You will receive:
- A concept snippet (from staging_snapshot.md).
- Optional concept guideline modules that refine tone, themes, or constraints.
- An ethical authoring guideline that must be applied implicitly (do not mention it).

Write a single continuous draft in natural prose. Paragraph breaks are allowed, but do not use headings, bullet lists, or numbered lists. Do not include JSON, schema formatting, or meta commentary about prompts, models, policies, or being an AI. Do not use em dashes. Keep sensitive topics indirect: if intimacy is implied, fade to black and avoid explicit sexual description. Assume all characters are autonomous adults and avoid any age ambiguity.

Include clear signals of identity, voice, habits, behavioral cues, and context hooks that could inform later extraction. The result should read like a cohesive character vignette suitable for iterative editing.

Output exactly the draft and nothing else.

Tone: Neutral Modern / Contemporary

Write in clear, current, and unembellished language. Avoid stylization, heightened metaphor, or archaic phrasing. Emotional expression is present but understated and context-appropriate. Characters behave and speak in ways consistent with modern social norms and practical reasoning. The tone should feel observational and grounded, neither ironic nor earnest by default, allowing content to stand on its own without tonal distortion.

Third Person Limited (User-Centric)

Write in third person (“he,” “she,” “they”), but restrict internal access exclusively to the user character. The narrator may describe the user’s thoughts, emotions, assumptions, and interpretations, but must treat all other characters as externally observed only. Other characters’ intentions, thoughts, or feelings must be inferred through dialogue, behavior, or expression, never stated directly.

Never use second-person pronouns (no “you/your”). The user persona must be referenced only as `{{user}}`, never as “you” or “your.”

Style 3 — Modern, high diction, ornate and artful (baroque precision / literary artifice)

Goal: Produce luxuriant, highly controlled prose that rewards close reading: sensuous specificity, layered syntax, and deliberate rhetorical flourish.
Lexicon: High diction with occasional rare words; multilingual seasoning (a single foreign term or phrase when exact); precise adjectives; exacting sensory vocabulary.
Syntax: Long, syntactically intricate sentences with subordinate clauses; strategic commas/semicolons; occasional anastrophe or unusual word order for musicality; ensure every complexity earns meaning.
Rhetoric & Devices: Wordplay (subtle, not punny), internal rhyme/assonance, parenthetical glosses, etymological nods, sly metacommentary, and elegant ambiguity; employ figures like chiasmus, antanaclasis, and extended metaphoric fields.
Figurative language: Metaphors are cultivated and sustained; imagery is tactile and painterly; comparisons can be surprising but must remain legible in context.
Dialogue/Voice: Dialogue is polished; characters may speak in crafted, quotable lines; interiority can be richly textured without becoming purple.
Quality checks: Avoid purple sprawl: every flourish should sharpen characterization, perception, or theme; do not mimic any single copyrighted author—compose original artifice.

CONCEPT SNIPPET:
Setting: A wizard tower and the garden grounds in a dark ages, high-magic fantasy setting. FemalePOV. The user is meant to be an a teenager orphan with plant-nurturing magic and healing magic. The character is a mysterious, unnamed, old wizard, who rescued you from an orphanage make you the gardener of his magical garden. He has purple flowing robes and a pointy brimless wizard hat. He has long and gray beard and hair. As part of a schedule, the character will request the user to grow and harvest specific magic plants for potions and rituals.
