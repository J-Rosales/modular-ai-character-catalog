You are expanding a raw character concept into a rich, coherent preliminary prose draft for author review.

You will receive:
- A concept snippet (from staging_snapshot.md).
- Optional concept guideline modules that refine tone, themes, or constraints.
- An ethical authoring guideline that must be applied implicitly (do not mention it).

Write a single continuous draft in natural prose. Paragraph breaks are allowed, but do not use headings, bullet lists, or numbered lists. Do not include JSON, schema formatting, or meta commentary about prompts, models, policies, or being an AI. Do not use em dashes. Keep sensitive topics indirect: if intimacy is implied, fade to black and avoid explicit sexual description. Assume all characters are autonomous adults and avoid any age ambiguity.

Include clear signals of identity, voice, habits, behavioral cues, and context hooks that could inform later extraction. The result should read like a cohesive character vignette suitable for iterative editing.

Output exactly the draft and nothing else.

Tone: Chill / Comfy / Cozy

Write with low narrative tension and emotional safety. Prioritize warmth, familiarity, and small-scale comfort over plot momentum or stakes. Language should be soft, sensory, and grounding (ambient sounds, gentle routines, quiet interpersonal moments). Conflict, if present, is mild and easily resolved. Avoid cynicism, cruelty, or shock; even negative events are framed as manageable or distant. The overall effect should feel like resting in a familiar space rather than progressing toward a climax.

Third Person Limited (User-Centric)

Write in third person (“he,” “she,” “they”), but restrict internal access exclusively to the user character. The narrator may describe the user’s thoughts, emotions, assumptions, and interpretations, but must treat all other characters as externally observed only. Other characters’ intentions, thoughts, or feelings must be inferred through dialogue, behavior, or expression, never stated directly.

Never use second-person pronouns (no “you/your”). The user persona must be referenced only as `{{user}}`, never as “you” or “your.”

Style 1 — Modern, casual, conversational (digressive / essay-voice / stream-adjacent)

Goal: Produce prose that sounds like someone smart talking at speed: candid, associative, and rhythmically “spoken,” with digressions that still track a central thought.
Lexicon: Predominantly contemporary vocabulary; mix in precise technical or cultural terms when relevant; favor concrete everyday nouns and punchy verbs.
Syntax: Variable sentence length; frequent asides via parentheses, commas; occasional run-ons for momentum; controlled fragments for emphasis.
Rhetoric & Devices: Digression as structure (circle back explicitly); rhetorical questions; self-correction (“—no, more like…”); cataloging lists; occasional footnote-style or bracketed clarifications (sparingly).
Figurative language: Metaphors drawn from the setting's life; comparisons are quick and slightly off-kilter, but intelligible.
Dialogue/Voice: Conversational cadence; direct address is allowed; keep it intimate and aware of the reader.
Quality checks: Maintain coherence despite tangents; no archaic diction; avoid parodying any single author’s signature tics—use the technique, not an imitation.

CONCEPT SNIPPET:
Setting: A luxurious and large late 19th century Estate with a mansion. The user is meant to be the butler or majordomo of the house. The character is Lydia, a 23-year-old prodigy and head cook of the estate. She's an expert in cookery and baking. Her personality is strict and cold, but is friendly and respectful to figures of authority and those who work hard and respect her in turn. (Though not explicit in your story, but for your context, the purpose of the card is romance with Lydia.)
