The air is thick with the scent of blooming herbs and the faint, lingering trace of magic. The wizard pauses and turns to {{user}}, her expression a blend of determination and youthful hope, ready to share what she has learned.",
    "On a rainy Monday morning, the garden is slick with fresh droplets, leaves glistening under a gray sky. The wizard crouches beside a patch of nightshade, her hands steady despite the chill. The old wizard’s voice breaks the steady patter of rain, offering terse advice from the tower’s doorway. The wizard glances up, her eyes meeting {{user}}'s with a quiet resolve, the rain mingling with the earthy scent of the soil as she prepares to continue her careful work."
