# AGENTS.md — Neocities Bot Catalogue (SillyTavern) Codex Guide

Date: 2025-12-30

This repository builds a **static Neocities website** that catalogs SillyTavern character bots and lets users:
- browse a modern catalogue (landing + featured grid)
- filter by **freeform tags** with per-tag **OFF / INCLUDE / EXCLUDE**
- open a character view
- toggle **content modules** (variants) and choose **model transforms** (schema-like vs natural language, etc.)
- download assembled outputs (JSON, text packs, and optionally PNG), including **Download Everything** bundles

## Non-negotiables (decided)
- Hosting target: **Neocities** (static files only).
- Architecture: **client-side** HTML/CSS/JS; data-driven from JSON files.
- Tags: **freeform**; filtering is per-tag **OFF/INCLUDE/EXCLUDE**.
- Provenance: every character has an **original source link**; if redistribution “as-is” is not allowed, do **not** host a backup.
- Outputs: support **(a)** ST character JSON, **(b)** text prompt pack(s), **(c)** PNG card embedding (may be phased), **(d)** “download everything” per character, and **(e)** “download everything” site-wide (with defined defaults).

## Repository structure (assumed)
- `/src/` canonical site source (HTML/CSS/JS/data/assets)
- `/public/` deploy output (may mirror `/src/` or be a build copy)
- `/template-src/` unmodified third-party HTML template (verbatim)
- `/automation/` Codex directives + schemas + pipeline notes

## How work is divided
Codex should work from the directive files below. Each directive states:
- what is already decided
- what must be clarified before implementation
- tasks, acceptance criteria, and integration points

### Directives
1. **View + Navigation + Routing**
   - File: `automation/codex/DIRECTIVE_01_VIEW_NAV.md`

2. **Catalogue + Tag Filtering + Search**
   - File: `automation/codex/DIRECTIVE_02_CATALOG_FILTERS.md`

3. **Character Page UI + Variant Toggles**
   - File: `automation/codex/DIRECTIVE_03_CHARACTER_UI.md`

4. **Text/JSON Generation + Transform System**
   - File: `automation/codex/DIRECTIVE_04_GENERATION_TRANSFORMS.md`

5. **Download System (Blob/ZIP) + “Download Everything”**
   - File: `automation/codex/DIRECTIVE_05_DOWNLOADS_BUNDLES.md`

6. **Data Schema + Attribution/License Policy**
   - File: `automation/codex/DIRECTIVE_06_DATA_SCHEMA_ATTRIBUTION.md`

### Work order (preferred)
1) DIRECTIVE_06 (schema + policy) → 2) DIRECTIVE_01 (routes/views) → 3) DIRECTIVE_02 (catalog filters) →
4) DIRECTIVE_03 (character UI) → 5) DIRECTIVE_04 (generation/transforms) → 6) DIRECTIVE_05 (downloads/bundles)

Rationale: schema and policy drive everything; downloads depend on stable generation outputs.

## Coding standards (for this repo)
- Vanilla JS first (no framework). Small libraries allowed **only** for clear needs (e.g., ZIP).
- Avoid build tooling unless required; keep deploy simple for Neocities.
- Keep UI logic in modules (`/src/js/*`), keep content in `/src/data/*`.
- Accessibility: toggles are keyboard operable; visible focus; labels linked; ARIA where appropriate.

## Clarifications to ask the project owner (before implementation)
Codex should open an issue or produce a Q&A markdown if any of these are unresolved:
- Output formats: exact SillyTavern specs and versions (JSON schema details; PNG embedding format).
- “Download everything” defaults: which transform + which module set + which output files are included by default.
- Variant composition rules: ordering, mutual exclusions, conditionals (TBD but needs minimal contract).
- Transform contract: which transforms may alter content vs only presentation; how to represent transforms declaratively.
- Licensing metadata: minimum required fields and UI wording for “no redistribution” entries.
- Scale expectations: number of characters; target performance constraints.

## Deliverables Codex should produce early
- Minimal runnable site shell in `/src/` with:
  - landing page rendering featured cards from `/src/data/index.json`
  - character view loading `/src/data/characters/<slug>.json`
  - tag filter UI skeleton
- Schema drafts in `/automation/schemas/`
- Sample data in `/automation/samples/`
